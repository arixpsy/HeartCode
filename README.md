For the next few exercises you are required to find the correct div card sections and populate the divs with your own content. If you are using the chrome browser, you may want to use chrome's development tools(Press F12) to explore raw html of the website. View more below :point_down:

Depending on where your development console open, you may view the raw code of the webpage under the elements tab. You may hover over the html code and the rendered html elements will be highlight on the page itself. This is very useful if you are borrowing a html template from a external source and want to understand how the html elements look when it is rendered on the browser.

## Exercise 1(Tables and Headers):
1. Look for the div with the class of "card-section blue". Inside, you should be able to find a header tag of "Headers and Text".
```html
<div class="card-section blue">
    <h1>Headers and Text</h1>
    <p>Insert anything you want here</p>
</div>
```
2. For this exercise, you will have edit the contents of this div. Start of by changing the header text to "My Profile".

3. Next, using the ```<p>``` tag fill the divs with your name, age and hobbies. it should look something like this.
```
My Profile
Name: Arix
Age: 23
Hobbies: Programming, Sleeping
```
4. Next, insert a separating line with ```<hr>```. After the line, insert a list of things you like using ```<ol>``` and ```<li>``` tags.

    * Feel free to experiment with text formatting tags like ```<strike>```,```<u>``` and ```<strong>```.
    * You may want to use a break line ```<br>``` tag before and after the separating line to put some spacing.
5. After completing, it should look something like this :point_down:
